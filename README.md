3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
      (SDLC) is a structured process for building software. Here are its main phases, explained simply:

   -Requirements Gathering
      
      Understand what the software needs to do by talking to stakeholders.
      
      Define goals, features, and constraints.
      
   -Design
      
      Plan the system architecture, user interface, and workflows.
      
      Create blueprints (e.g., wireframes, diagrams) for development.
      
   - Implementation (Coding)
      
      Write the actual code based on the design.
      
      Developers build features and integrate components.
      
   -Testing
      
      Check for bugs, errors, and performance issues.
      
      Ensure the software works as intended and meets requirements.
      
   -Deployment

   -Maintenance
      
      Fix bugs, update features, and improve performance over time.
      
      Ensure the software stays relevant and functional.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    Waterfall .                                                                     Agile.
   - Sequential, linear process ;                                                    - Iterative, incremental process- Breaks work into short cycles, builds on each cycle.
    One phase finishes before the next starts, like steps.                          - Requirements evolve throughout -Needs can change, flexibility is built-in.
   - Requirements defined upfront ;                                                  - Flexible scope - What's built can adjust as needed.
   All needs are known and set before work begins.                                   - Emphasis on working software - Functional product matters most, less focus on paperwork.                       - Fixed scope - What's built is fully defined at the start.                        - Adaptive timeline - Schedule adapts as work progresses.
   - Emphasis on documentation - Detailed plans and records are key.                   - High customer involvement throughout - Customer is part of the process, gives constant feedback.
   -Predictable timeline - Schedule is set and followed strictly.
   - Less customer involvement during development ;                                   - Suitable for projects with changing requirements, uncertainty, and a need for flexibility ; Best when
     Customer gives feedback only at specific points.                                      you're exploring, or things might shift.
    - Suitable for projects with stable requirements, well-defined scope,                  
      and minimal changes Best when you know exactly what you need.
